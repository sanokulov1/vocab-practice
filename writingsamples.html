                <div class="question-block">
                    <p><strong>Topic: Cyclists and car drivers sharing the same road might cause some problems.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Question: What are the problems? What could be done to solve those problems?</strong></p>
                </div>
                <p>In many countries, due to inadequate road <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="The basic physical and organizational structures and facilities (e.g., buildings, roads, power supplies) needed for the operation of a society or enterprise.">infrastructure</span>, drivers and cyclists have to use the same road. This naturally leads to several challenges and problems, some of which include safety concerns and increased levels of traffic congestion. However, developing dedicated bike lanes can <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="Make less severe, serious, or painful.">mitigate</span> those problems.</p>
                <p>The <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="The state or fact of existing together at the same time or in the same place.">coexistence</span> of different modes of transportation on the same road increases the risks of accidents and collisions. One primary concern stems from the speed differences between motorized vehicles and cyclists. The former usually operates at a higher speed and the speed discrepancy can create hazardous situations when sharing the road with cyclists. This challenge can be <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="Make (a problem, bad situation, or negative feeling) worse.">exacerbated</span> by road users failing to adapt to these varying speeds, leading to collisions particularly at intersections and during overtaking maneuvers.</p>
                <p>The speed difference may even contribute to traffic congestion. Naturally, when there is a stark difference in speeds, this can hinder the smooth flow of traffic, leading to <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="A point of congestion and obstruction in a system or network.">bottlenecks</span> or slower overall travel. This is especially bad during peak hours, when the volume of traffic is large.</p>
                <p>These challenges, however, can be somewhat overcome once dedicated bike lanes are provided. The <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="The action of dividing or parting something.">segregation</span> can significantly reduce the chances of accidents and collisions as cyclists can travel without the constant concern of sharing the road with high speed vehicles. The separation of bike lanes from motorized traffic can also improve the predictability for both cyclists and drivers, making it easier to carry out maneuvers. This can lead to a safer environment.</p>
                <p>Apart from this, the introduction of bike lanes contributes to a smoother flow of traffic. When there is a designated space for cyclists, the potential conflicts and disruptions caused by the speed difference are minimized. This can help <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="Make (suffering, deficiency, or a problem) less severe.">alleviate</span> congestion, particularly during peak hours as each mode of transportation can operate independently.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, drivers and cyclists sharing the same road poses a number of challenges, including higher risks of accidents and heightened traffic congestion. The most feasible solution to these problems would be to allocate exclusive cycling lanes.</p>

                     <p><strong>Topic: Many cities are now turning parks and farmland into new housing developments.</strong></p>
                     <p><strong>Question: Is this a positive or negative development?</strong></p>
                </div>
                <p>Cities these days tend to prioritize offering more housing to people, and these developments often come at the expense of farmlands and parks. While this trend brings certain positives, it is an undesirable turn of events overall.</p>
                <p>The creation of housing opportunities helps meet the growing demand for <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="Lodging or a place to live.">accommodation</span>. In recent years, rural-to-urban migration has increased, with many people choosing to settle in cities. This has inevitably led to housing shortages. When there are enough living quarters in the form of apartment blocks and multi-storey buildings, not only can people purchase a home of their choice, but rental prices may also decrease.</p>
                <p>Additionally, urban development often contributes to higher standards of living. This is because the introduction of new housing is usually accompanied by the creation of a range of public <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="A desirable or useful feature or facility of a building or place.">amenities</span> such as schools, hospitals, playgrounds, supermarkets, shopping malls, and entertainment facilities. By contrast, in areas where such developments are absent, people may lack access to many essential services.</p>
                <p>In my opinion, however, the disappearance of farmland and, especially, parks in favor of housing construction has two-fold <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="The effect or result of something implied or understood.">implications</span>. For one, it can have a detrimental effect on people‚Äôs mental well-being. City life has long been associated with higher levels of stress and anxiety due to its fast-paced nature. Access to green spaces serves as a vital <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="A factor, force, or influence that tends to neutralize or oppose an opposing force.">counterbalance</span> to this stress, and if people are deprived of it, urban living may become even more taxing on mental health.</p>
                <p>Alongside this, a range of other problems may arise from unchecked <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="The process of making an area more urban.">urbanization</span>. As the <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="An arrival or entry of a large number of people or things.">influx</span> of people into cities increases, noise and air pollution, traffic congestion, and overcrowding are likely to become common. These changes can significantly diminish the overall quality of life for city-dwellers.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, the positive effects of expanding living spaces, even at the cost of parks and farmlands, include meeting the public demand for housing and improving living standards. However, I still view this trend negatively because it exacerbates the stress associated with urban life and leads to a range of undesirable consequences for residents.</p>

                    <p><strong>Topic: Some people believe that it is important for governments to spend more money putting in famous works of art like paintings and statues in cities to make them better places to live in.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Question: To what extent do you agree or disagree?</strong></p>
                </div>
                <p>How to make cities better places to live is a major concern for many government departments. Among the various approaches proposed, one that stands out is investing in the installation of well-known art pieces and statues throughout urban areas. While investment in such projects offers certain benefits, allocating government resources to urban <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="The action of making something more beautiful.">beautification</span> efforts would ultimately be a waste.</p>
                <p>It can be argued that investing in public art and beautification projects can foster national pride and contribute to a city‚Äôs unique identity. Well-designed public spaces that incorporate art can make cities more attractive, drawing tourists, encouraging social interaction, and improving residents‚Äô emotional connection to their surroundings. In fact, aesthetically pleasing environments have been shown to reduce stress levels, providing residents with a more <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="Inspiring hope, confidence, or cheerfulness.">uplifting</span> and positive urban experience.</p>
                <p>This argument <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="In spite of what has just been said; nevertheless.">notwithstanding</span>, other more important matters should take precedence. First and foremost, cities today face more pressing problems that demand immediate attention and funding. Issues such as housing shortages, traffic congestion, pollution, and inadequate public transportation systems have a direct and daily impact on residents‚Äô quality of life. Investing public money into solving these problems would provide tangible, long-term benefits, whereas art installations, although visually appealing, offer no practical improvement to the urban experience.</p>
                <p>Moreover, beautification through statues and artwork often serves only a small segment of the population, particularly tourists or art enthusiasts, rather than addressing the broader needs of all residents. Public funds should prioritize <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="Including or covering all the services, facilities, or items normally expected or desired.">inclusive</span> projects that benefit the majority, such as building parks, upgrading healthcare facilities, or creating safer pedestrian zones. These initiatives not only enhance the visual appeal of a city but also improve public health, safety, and community well-being.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, although investment in public art and beautification projects can offer certain cultural and emotional benefits, it should not be prioritized over addressing the more urgent challenges that cities face today. By focusing on essential services such as housing, transportation, and public health, cities can create better environments.</p>

                <p>Today, many museums around the world contain art and artifacts that were stolen from their countries of origin during colonial rule or looted during war. With countries increasingly reflecting on their colonial history and seeking to <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="Return (someone) to their own country.">repatriate</span> these artefacts, museums face a serious question: should they return historical artifacts that do not rightfully belong to them. I, for one, have no hesitation in saying yes.</p>
                <p>There are, however, arguments for why museums should keep these artifacts. In some cases, there is a legitimate question as to whether the repatriated artefacts would be safe in their new location. There are a number of instances of artefacts being poorly stored or maintained in museums which lack sufficient funding or expertise, as well as examples of items being damaged or stolen due to unrest. A <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="Relevant or applicable to a particular matter; apposite.">pertinent</span> example would be the looting of Egypt‚Äôs National Museum led to permanent historical damage ‚Äì an outcome arguably less likely in major international institutions.</p>
                <p>Despite this, I am in full favor of returning historical artifacts to their rightful owners. The fundamental argument for repatriating stolen artifacts is a moral one. Historical items <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="Discover or reveal (something previously hidden or unknown).">unearthed</span> on the land of other countries remain the property of those countries, regardless of who discovered them or who ruled the land at the time. To keep such artifacts is to <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="Continue (something undesirable or an unwelcome situation) in an uninterrupted or undiminished way.">perpetuate</span> the original injustice, as it denies countries the right to reclaim pieces of their own history and identity.</p>
                <p>Aside from being morally <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="Impossible to justify or defend.">indefensible</span>, retaining stolen artifacts is also a profound cultural injustice. The artifacts do not have cultural significance to the countries and museums in which they‚Äôre displayed, or what significance they have is detached from the places and times they came from. By returning the artifacts to these countries, they can be displayed for local people to experience aspects of their culture that they have been denied, learning from the past and reflecting on their history and culture.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, while concerns about the preservation and security of artifacts are understandable, they do not outweigh the moral and cultural <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="A principle or standard of quality.">imperative</span> to return stolen heritage to its rightful owners. Through repatriation, we honor the true significance of these objects and allow the communities from which they came to reconnect with their own past.</p>

                <p>Honesty is the best policy. There is a view that this popular <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="A short pithy saying in general use, stating a general truth or piece of advice.">proverb</span> is highly applicable to relationships between people ‚Äì be they personal, familial, or professional. I believe that being honest and truthful is the most fundamental <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="A strong, vertical support or foundation for something.">pillar</span> of healthy and thriving relationships as it promotes openness among people, improves communication, and contributes to the longevity of the relationship.</p>
                <p>Truthfulness <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="Encourage or promote the development of (something good, especially something that is desirable).">fosters</span> openness in relationships. When people are honest with each other, it creates an environment where they feel comfortable expressing themselves and sharing their thoughts, feelings, and experiences. This, in turn, promotes deeper connections and allows for genuine understanding between people. By contrast, when truthfulness is lacking in a relationship, it leads to suspicion, doubt, and insecurity.</p>
                <p>Additionally, being open and honest leads to better communication between people. Honest communication is crucial for effective and meaningful interactions as it allows for open discussions, problem-solving, and addressing conflicts in a productive manner. Without open and truthful dialogue, issues remain unresolved, and <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="Bitter indignation at having been treated unfairly.">resentment</span> can build. The relationship may suffer from a lack of clarity and understanding.</p>
                <p>Truthfulness can also help relationships last long. When there is a culture of honesty and trust, it strengthens the bond between individuals, while being dishonest or concealing the truth can <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="Break or cause to break; split.">fracture</span> these bonds. Constant dishonesty or lying can result in emotional distance between people, and as a result, the relationship may become strained or even irreparable.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, truth is the most important component of any relationship because it leads to transparency, better interactions, and stability between couples, family members, friends, and colleagues. Without it, relationships hardly ever thrive.</p>

                <span><strong>Band 8.5 | 316 words</strong></span>
            </button>
            <div class="content">
                <div class="question-block">
                    <p><strong>Topic: It is suggested that primary school children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Question: Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?</strong></p>
                </div>
                <p>There is a proposal to teach primary school children about gardening and animal <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="The care, cultivation, and breeding of crops and animals.">husbandry</span>. Although there are some difficulties associated with this <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="An act or strategy intended to resolve a difficulty or improve a situation; a fresh approach to something.">initiative</span>, the advantages of implementing it are much greater than the disadvantages.</p>
                <p>One drawback has to do with the cost associated with setting up a garden or animal husbandry program. As it requires resources and funding, it may not be financially <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="Possible to do easily or conveniently.">feasible</span> for all schools to invest in such programs. If the lessons were all theoretical, I see not much use in them. One can argue that children can practice the knowledge learnt in schools in their own gardens or farms. However, this is a practical challenge for children who live in urban areas, where there is little to no chance to grow plants or keep animals. Creating a plot for cultivating crops and raising animals in a shared area requires financial backing too.</p>
                <p>Another problem is that maintaining a garden or small farm requires much time and effort. Watering plants on a regular basis and weeding, feeding animals and cleaning stalls, for example, take hours. As a result, teachers and students may have to sacrifice other academic activities to practice these, which may not prove productive in the long run.</p>
                <p>Despite these negatives, introducing gardening and animal keeping into the school curriculum brings about a range of benefits. To start, these programs increase environmental awareness. Learning about gardening and animals, in general, can help children develop a greater appreciation for the natural world and their role in protecting it.</p>
                <p>Another advantage is that children develop food literacy. By growing their own produce and caring for animals, children can have a better understanding of where their food comes from and how it is produced. By developing food literacy skills, children can make more informed choices about what they eat and develop healthier eating habits.</p>
                <p>Finally, gardening and farming lessons can play an important role in skill development. This is because gardening and animal care require a range of skills. For example, when children plant or harvest crops, they learn about the importance of planning, timing, and teamwork. These skills will prove useful at later stages of children's lives.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, while there are some downsides associated with bringing gardening and animal care programs into the school curriculum, as it requires investment, time, and effort, they are not as significant as the potential benefits. These programs make children more environmentally conscious, increase food knowledge, and help them learn more skills.</p>

                    <p><strong>Question: Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.</strong></p>
                </div>
                <p>There is a debate about the relative importance of job satisfaction and job security, with some arguing that job satisfaction is more critical for overall well-being and others asserting that a permanent job is more valuable. In my opinion, workers should prioritize job satisfaction over anything else.</p>
                <p>A permanent job provides stability. With this type of job, employees can have <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="A positive declaration designed to give confidence.">assurance</span> that their jobs will continue in the long term, as long as they perform well and meet the expectations of their employers. This can reduce the stress and anxiety that comes with the uncertainty of temporary or contract positions. When individuals have stable employment, they are better able to save for future expenses, and make financial decisions with confidence. In addition to this, permanent jobs often come with more comprehensive benefits packages than temporary jobs. These may include health insurance, retirement plans, paid time off and many other <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="An incidental or additional payment, benefit, or privilege.">perks</span> that can enhance an employee‚Äôs overall well-being.</p>
                <p>Despite these benefits, I believe job satisfaction should be the main priority. To start, it is linked to overall well-being and quality of life. When individuals feel <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="Satisfied or happy because of fully developing one's abilities or character.">fulfilled</span> and satisfied with their work, they are more likely to experience positive emotions, have better mental health, and enjoy better physical health. Conversely, low job satisfaction often leads to stress, <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="Physical or mental collapse caused by overwork or stress.">burnout</span> and negative health outcomes. Job satisfaction can also impact employee retention and recruitment. Satisfied workers are likely to stay with their current employers, reducing turnover costs for the organization. They may also recommend their organization to others as a great place to work, helping to attract high-quality candidates.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, there are apparent advantages to having a permanent job. However, having job satisfaction is even more significant as it improves people‚Äôs well-being and life quality and it brings about several benefits to organizations as well.</p>

                    <p><strong>Question: What are the reasons? What can be done?</strong></p>
                </div>
                <p>The majority of elderly people avoid doing physical exercise. While this can be attributed to a high risk of injury and lack of sporting facilities, the situation can be <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="Make (suffering, deficiency, or a problem) less severe.">alleviated</span> by hiring a personal trainer and offering more opportunities to do sports.</p>
                <p>The fear of injury is one factor that may prevent old people from doing sports. As people age, they tend to become weaker and <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="Especially liable or open to something undesirable or harmful.">susceptible</span> to injuries. If they pick up an injury, it may take a long time for them to recover. So, old people often think they are better off without any exercise. Inadequate sporting facilities can be another reason. Many neighborhoods do not offer basic opportunities for doing sports, such as gyms, football pitches, or swimming pools. People may feel <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="Showing reluctance or unwillingness.">reluctant</span> to take up sports, if these facilities are far away from where they live.</p>
                <p>However, there are several ways by which the issue can be resolved. Firstly, people should consider hiring a personal trainer. When a professional coach creates exercise regimes and works together with old people, this can reduce the chances of exercise-related injuries. This can encourage the elderly to do sports more frequently. Providing enough opportunities for sports in neighborhoods can also be effective. If there are gyms, tennis courts, swimming pools, and football pitches nearby, many old people are likely to grow interest in doing sports.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, the main reasons why many old people do not do sports are a high risk of injury and insufficient sporting facilities. However, working with a personal trainer and access to sporting facilities can encourage elderly people to do exercise.</p>

                </div>
                <p>There is a view that people today have a higher quality of life than in the past. While modern life has its problems, people are living much better life than in previous times.</p>
                <p>One main threat we face today is environmental disasters. Due to factors such as rapid <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="The development of industries in a country or region on a wide scale.">industrialization</span>, deforestation, and increased production, air pollution and global warming have become major problems. These human-induced issues have resulted in the loss of <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="The variety of life in the world or in a particular habitat or ecosystem.">biodiversity</span> and emergence of several health issues, affecting millions of people around the world. In the past, however, people tended to enjoy richer biodiversity and cleaner environment.</p>
                <p>Despite these problems, life today is much better for the majority. Firstly, recent years have seen major advancements in medicine. Some of the recent <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="A significant and sudden advance, development, or achievement.">breakthroughs</span> in this field include antibiotics, vaccines, and technologies that allow for effective diagnosis.

                <p>A better work-life balance is another factor that contributes to happier life.

                    <p><strong>Topic: Watching a live performance such as a play, concert, or sporting event is more enjoyable than watching the same event on television.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Question: To what extent do you agree or disagree?</strong></p>
                </div>
                <p>There is a widely held view that experiencing a live performance, such as a play, concert, or sporting event, provides a greater sense of enjoyment compared to watching the same event on television. I agree with this notion as live performances offer a sense of excitement, shared experience, and unexpected surprises.</p>
                <p>First and foremost, being physically present in a theater, concert hall, or stadium provides people with a sense of excitement and energy that cannot be <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="Make an exact copy of; reproduce.">replicated</span> on television. Being in a live audience allows people to feel the atmosphere and engage with performers or athletes, creating a unique and memorable experience. Also, attending a live performance can sometimes offer the opportunity to interact with performers or athletes in various ways, such as getting autographs, taking pictures, or asking them questions after the show.</p>
                <p>Moreover, live performances create a sense of community. When people attend such events, whether with friends or complete strangers, they can share in the emotions and reactions of the audience. During a music concert, for example, as the artist performs their hits, the crowd sings along, and people feel a sense of belonging and unity. Similarly, when attending a live theater performance, the reactions of the audience can add to the overall experience. Laughter, gasps, or cheers from others can <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="Increase the volume of (sound) or to make more intense.">amplify</span> the emotions of the moment and enhance the overall impact of the performance.</p>
                <p>Finally, live performances often feature surprises. <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="The act of creating or performing (music, drama, or verse) spontaneously without preparation.">Improvisations</span>, changes to the script, or unplanned moments can add an element of <span class="highlighted-word" data-definition="The quality of being spontaneous and natural rather than planned in advance.">spontaneity</span> and excitement to the performance that cannot be experienced through a pre-recorded and extensively edited broadcast. A pertinent example of such a surprise is the live performance of the Broadway musical 'The Lion King,' in which the actor playing Mufasa unexpectedly broke character and addressed a disruptive audience member, telling them to stop taking flash photography. This generated huge laughter, and many after the show praised the actor's quick thinking and dedication to the show. However, this scene was edited out from the final version released to the public.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, live performances undoubtedly offer more enjoyment to the viewers because they are more exciting, unite people, and contain an element of surprise.</p>
